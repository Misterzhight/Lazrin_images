  <p>
    My name is <strong>Lazrin</strong>. I was born in <strong>2005</strong>. I am someone who is curious about the world and loves to learn new things.
  </p>
  <p>

    I started school in <strong>Bonon</strong>, where I lived with my father. At that time, my mother was living in another city because she was continuing her studies. When I grew older, around the age of 8, I went to live with my grandmother. She took care of me and supported me as I grew up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like <strong>science, English, and music</strong>. I enjoy discovering new ideas, learning how things work, and improving myself every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my main skills is that I am <strong>good at English</strong>, and I continue to practise and develop it.
